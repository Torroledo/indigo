<p>Undergraduate student of Physics and graduated Economist from the Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. I am interested in scientific computing and modeling in several areas like: Astrophysics, phenomelogical analysis of data using Machine and Deep Learning techniques in High Energy Physics, Computational Macroeconomics and Global Method Solutions. Since the last year I have been working at the Banco de la Republica, the Central Bank of Colombia, developing Dynamics Stochastic General Equilibrium models for optimal monetary policy analysis using High Performance Computing tools like Distributed and Shared Computing (MPI, OpenMP) and numerical methods and libraries (LINPACK, LAPACK, BLAS, TASMANIAN).</p>

<p> Passionate about techonology and entrepreneurship.</p>
