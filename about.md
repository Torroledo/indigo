<p>Undergraduate student of Physics and graduated Economist from the Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. I am interested in scientific computing and modeling in several areas like: Astrophysics, phenomelogical analysis of data using Machine and Deep Learning techniques in High Energy Physics, Computational Macroeconomics and Global Method Solutions. Since the last year, I have been working at the Banco de la Republica, the Central Bank of Colombia, as Economist, Developer and Research Assistant. As Developer I have been implementing forecasting and predictive models for Monetary Policy analysis using DSGE's, ML, Bayesian Statistics and Time Series Econometrics. Also, I have experience in the Front End of the final implementations of predictable models, at servicy of the board of directors for monetary policy analysis, using Java, Visual Basic and Matlab GUI tools. As a Reserch Assistant i have been developing DSGE models for optimal Monetary Policy analysis using High Performance Computing tools like Distributed and Shared Computing (MPI, OpenMP) and numerical methods and libraries (LINPACK, LAPACK, BLAS, TASMANIAN). Some of my main research areas are event classification in High Energy Physics using Machine and Deep Learning & DSGE models using Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p> Passionate about techonology and entrepreneurship.</p>
