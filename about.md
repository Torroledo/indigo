<p>Undergraduate student of Physics and graduated Economist from the Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. I am interested in scientific computing and modeling in several areas like: Astrophysics, phenomelogical analysis of data using Machine and Deep Learning techniques in High Energy Physics, Computational Macroeconomics and Global Method Solutions. Since the last year, I have been working at the Banco de la Republica, the Central Bank of Colombia, as Economist, Developer and Research Assistant. As Developer of Monetary Policy analysis tools and models, I have been developing and implementing forecasting and predictive models using DSGE's, ML, Bayesian Statistics and Time Series Econometrics. As a Reserch Assistant I have been developing DSGE models for optimal Monetary Policy analysis using High Performance Computing tools like Distributed and Shared Computing (MPI, OpenMP) and numerical methods and libraries (LINPACK, LAPACK, BLAS, TASMANIAN). Some of my main research areas are event classification in High Energy Physics using Machine and Deep Learning & DSGE models with Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p> Passionate about techonology and entrepreneurship.</p>
